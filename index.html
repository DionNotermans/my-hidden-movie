    <h1>My favorite movie</h1>
    <p>In this magazine we are going to talk extensively about my favorite film, namely Cars the movie.<br> 
        Various topics will be discussed, but more about that later.</p>

        <h2>Why the movie Cars?</h2>
        <p>I chose the movie Cars, because I watched it a lot as a child and I was reminded of this recently when my brother was watching it again.<br> 
            That's what makes it such a good movie. It doesn't matter how old you are, it's still a fun movie for the whole family.</p>
            <p>Several parts of the film have come out over the years.<br> 
                Part 1 started with a racing car that ends up in a quiet city and through the different parts you see this racing car grow into a true champion.</p>
